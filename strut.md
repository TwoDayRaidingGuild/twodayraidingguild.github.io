## Maut

### Corruption Damage

* Eye of Corruption - 16 hits for 335k (9th of 20)

### Notes

* Multi-target Spec
* Didn't eat before pull
* Stands on Melee side of Maut at ~0:38
* Died with Divine Shield, Healthstone, Healthpot available
* Took 330k damage in a one second window (~60% HP)

### Summary

Unsure why he ran to ranged side for a brief window, but nothing too alarming.

## Il'gynoth

### Corruption Damage

* Eye of Corruption - 106 hits for 3.1M (6th of 20)
* Grand Delusions - 4 hits for 743k (4th of 8)

### Notes

* First death on first pull.  Damage from seven seconds before his death is 233k from Eye of Corruption and 190k from Grand Delusion

### Summary

Did fine overall with mechanics while doing damage.  Need to keep an eye on corruption use in case it becomes a consistent problem.
