## Shad'har

### Corruption Damage

- Eye of Corruption - 3 hits for 23k (18th of 20)
- Grand Delusions - 2 hits for 340k (6th of 11)

### Notes

- Low corruption damage taken (Improvement)
- Died from Slurry Outburst, had less than half health when he got hit and still had healthpot/healthstone available (Consistent issue)
- Saved the pull after his death by being vocal immediately after he died, letting someone else feed Shad'har

### Summary

Showing minor improvement from last week by using Shield of Vengeance more and taking less corruption damage, but is still dying with self healing options available that would have prevented his death.

## Ra-den

### Corruption Damage

- Eye of Corruption - 29 hits for 716k (3rd of 20)

### Notes

- Died with Healthstone and Healthpot available but took 90% of his health in one global (Void Eruption)
- Death was more reasonable because he was trying to get away from Sebrik with charged bonds:

- He and Noober were the only people that didn't spread for Unleashed Nightmare, causing both to take an extra hit.
