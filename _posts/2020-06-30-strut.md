## Maut

### Corruption Damage

- Eye of Corruption - 16 hits for 335k (9th of 20)

### Notes

- Multi-target Spec
- Didn't eat before pull
- Died with Divine Shield, Healthstone, Healthpot available
- Took 330k damage in a one second window (~60% HP)
- Ran along the Melee side of Maut to get to drop devoured abyss at ~0:38 then again at ~40 to hide from Annihilation

### Summary

Unsure why he ran along the ranged side to clear curse, but luckily it was in between Black Wings casts.  His death on this pull is understandable.

## Il'gynoth

### Summary

Strut does have a pretty solid DPS rotation, but it rarely gets to shine because of his struggles with mechanics and ultimately, deaths.
