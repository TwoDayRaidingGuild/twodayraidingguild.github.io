## Maut

### Corruption Damage

* Eye of Corruption - 16 hits for 500k (7th of 20)
* Grand Delusions - 1 hits for 177k (5th of 6)

### Notes

* Good opening Combust, but scuffed second (didn't font, badge, or metoer)
* Used both Healthstone and Healthpot

### Summary

At least knows his combust rotation and quickly identifies when he gets a lucid proc.  His second combust looks like he didn't plan ahead since font becomes available midway through first stone phase.
