## Maut

### Corruption Damage

* Eye of Corruption - 16 hits for 500k (7th of 20)
* Grand Delusions - 1 hits for 177k (5th of 6)

### Notes

* Good opening Combust, but scuffed second (didn't font, badge, or metoer)
* Used both Healthstone and Healthpot

### Summary

At least knows his combust rotation and quickly identifies when he gets a lucid proc.  His second combust looks like he didn't plan ahead since font becomes available midway through first stone phase.

## Il'gynoth

### Corruption Damage

* Eye of Corruption - 142 hits for 4.4M (2nd of 20)
* Grand Delusions - 3 hits for 557k (5th of 8)

### Notes

- First time doing the fight on Mythic
- Followed the mechanics pretty well on all the pulls
- Moderate damage output
- Has some big gaps of just stopping dps when a mechanic happens and filling the void consuming FB charges and Hot Streak

### Summary

Did pretty decently despite never seeing the fight or knowing ahead of time he was going to be doing it.  Damage wasn't great, but most things that are preventing him from doing more damage are centered around fight mechanics.  We need to see him on more pulls to know if he can learn and adjust with experience.
